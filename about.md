I am an Italian software developer.  
In 2021 I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineer at the University of Bologna. Now I moved to Berlin and I am currently living there.

Programming has always been my main passion: I started in middle school with VBScript (:ghost:) to create _"fake viruses"_ to send to friends (the ones that show pop-ups like **"Your computer is infected! Send me all your money!!"**).  
This is how I discovered the <span style="color: purple;">sorcery</span> that allows programmers to impose their own will to the computer (sometimes) and I fell in love with it.

In the last few years I also became an _"outdoor lover"_ :mountain:, so in my free time I often prefer to move away from the computer and spend some time outdoors hiking, camping or just chilling in a hammock in the forest.
