Hello everyone!  
I want to leverage the first post ever on this blog to detail its goals and motivations.
I'm laying down the foundations for future posts.

I expect them to change over time, to reflect my interests and priorities.

## Become a better writer
Primarily, this blog is going to be an excuse to write more. I want to improve my style, broaden my vocabulary and get used to writing.
I realize more and more how important this skill is in my daily life.  
On the one hand, it allows me to communicate with others more effectively in both formal and informal situations.
It's not just about the **content** of my documents, e-mails, chat messages, etc; the **style** I use plays a big role in others' perception of me and what I'm communicating.  
On the other hand, writing forces me to choose the right words and form meaningful sentences to express my thoughts precisely.
I have to reflect to deeply **understand** them, thus increasing awareness and thinking clearer.
All of this is likely what makes writing difficult -- it requires bringing order to the natural chaos of thoughts, which takes effort and time.

## Experiment with software tools
As a developer, I love to learn new tools and experiment with them.
In this case, I am working mainly with Jekyll and Jenkins, but also other secondary things to self-host this blog.
I am pretty sure this experience will come in handy at some point, but regardless it will be a lot of fun.

## Have a personal journal
I plan to publish articles about what I am passionate about, what I learn, my opinions, and my experiments.
I am interested to see how all these things change and evolve over time.
It will also become a repository for what I do, to be able to reuse, in the future, the knowledge I have now.

## So... Why is this a blog? :thinking:
I know, why isn't this "blog" private?
Knowing that someone is probably going to read what I write pushes me to put more effort into it to achieve higher quality.
I also hope something of what I do will be able to somebody else.
Maybe just to have a different point of view, or to have some kind of reference.

Perhaps I will close the blog at some point, depending on how it is going to evolve.  
Only time will tell.
